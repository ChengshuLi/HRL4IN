Preliminary code release for the CoRL 2019 paper: [HRL4IN: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interactive Navigation with Mobile Manipulators](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11432)

The PPO implementation is partially adopted from [pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail](https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail) and [habitat-api](https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-api)

Code cleanup will be done in the next few weeks. Stay tuned.
